 Write && Compile with Emacs-Nox for ATMega328p && LearnCBot Shield

 References

 int, fade, pin analogWrite, analogRead

 Course material

 Arduino switch exemple modified by my own

 The LearnCBot have 4 leds (2 green and 2 red)
 This source code light on to off and on them all with one button.

 The red and green don't fade the same maner not because of the program
 but because of the property of the material itself.
